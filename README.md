## 🚀 AI Architect Learning Roadmap


### Phase 1: Foundations (1–2 months)

👉 Goal: Build confidence in ML/AI basics without going too deep into research math.

Python refresher (focus on NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

ML concepts: Regression, Classification, Clustering (use scikit-learn)

Key Math (just enough):

Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices)

Probability (distributions, Bayes theorem)

Gradient Descent (optimization idea)


Project: Build a simple ML pipeline (e.g., predict house prices, classify images).



---

### Phase 2: Deep Learning & LLM Basics (2–3 months)

👉 Goal: Understand modern AI models + how to apply them.

Learn PyTorch (preferred over TF for industry adoption)

Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs → just to know how they work

Transformers & LLMs (attention mechanism, HuggingFace models)

Fine-tuning & embeddings

Project: Build a text classifier using BERT (HuggingFace).



---

### Phase 3: Applied AI (2–3 months)

👉 Goal: Build production-ready AI-powered applications.

LLM APIs: OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere

RAG systems (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with vector DBs (Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS)

LangChain / LlamaIndex frameworks for orchestration

Prompt engineering best practices

Project: Build a chatbot that answers from your company’s documents using RAG.



---

### Phase 4: MLOps & Deployment (2–3 months)

👉 Goal: Learn how to deploy, monitor, and scale AI systems.

Docker & Kubernetes for containerization & orchestration

CI/CD for ML (MLflow, Kubeflow, Airflow)

Model serving: FastAPI, TorchServe, TensorFlow Serving

Monitoring (drift detection, retraining triggers)

Project: Deploy a model on AWS/GCP with autoscaling.



---

### Phase 5: AI System Architecture (3–4 months)

👉 Goal: Move from engineer → architect mindset.

Designing end-to-end AI systems:

Data pipeline (Kafka/Spark/Airflow)

Model training (batch vs online)

Model serving (real-time vs batch inference)

Feedback loops (human-in-the-loop, retraining)


Cloud AI services (AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex AI, Azure AI)

Security & governance (data privacy, compliance, cost optimization)

Case studies: Design ChatGPT-like app, Recommendation System, Fraud Detection AI.

Project: Draw and build an architecture for an AI-driven SaaS product.



---

### Phase 6: Leadership & Innovation (ongoing)

👉 Goal: Position yourself as a thought leader in AI systems.

Keep up with research papers (but focus on applied ones)

Contribute to AI product strategy (where to apply AI, cost/benefit)

Mentor juniors on AI concepts

Write blogs, give tech talks (strengthens your architect positioning).



---

🏆 Final Outcome

By following this roadmap, you’ll:

Have hands-on ML/AI coding skills

Know how to apply LLMs in real-world products

Be able to design scalable AI architectures

Transition from Senior Developer → AI Architect 🚀
